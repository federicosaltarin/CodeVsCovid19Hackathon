# CodeVsCovid19Hackathon
Scripts developed during the Hackathon CodeVsCovid19 27-30 Mar 2020 for the project Corona Science


The synthetic data script generates a CSV file with synthetic data of n users (e.g. 1000) for n days (e.g.20) with information about temperature (Celsius) and Covid19 related symptoms (e.g. coughing, loss of smell... eiter TRUE or FALSE) as well as other "social" information about the users.
The idea is to have a first data "playground" to start with data analysis of the future "real" data collected by the Corona Science mobile app.
